# Bar Chart Visualization with Confidence Intervals and Interactive Slider


## Overview

This project visualizes probabilistic data using bar charts with 95% confidence intervals, allowing users to explore deviations from a Value of Interest (V of I) interactively. It showcases data generated for four years (1992â€“1995), where each year's values represent simulated datasets. The visualization integrates an interactive slider for adjusting the V of I, dynamically updating the chart and highlighting deviations.

Inspired by the work of Ferreira et al. (2014) on sample-oriented task-driven visualizations, this project helps users make better, more confident decisions when interpreting probabilistic data.

## Features

1. Bar Chart with Error Bars: Displays average values for each year with 95% confidence intervals.
2. Interactive Slider: Users can set a custom Value of Interest (V of I), dynamically updating the chart.
3. Color-Coded Bars: Bars are shaded using a gradient to indicate deviations from the V of I.
  - Positive deviations: Red hues
      - Red hues: Indicate that the average value for a given year is higher than the V of I. The intensity of the red hue corresponds to how much higher the average is; darker reds mean a larger positive deviation.
  - Negative deviations: Blue hues
      - Blue hues: Indicate that the average value for a given year is lower than the V of I. The intensity of the blue hue corresponds to how much lower the average is; darker blues mean a larger negative deviation.  
  - Near-zero deviations: White
4. Tooltips: Each bar includes a label showing its height (number of votes), enhancing interpretability.
5. Clean Visualization: Chart "dejunked" by removing unnecessary elements and focusing on the data.
